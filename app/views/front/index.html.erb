  	 <h3 class="title">Why should I do this ?</h3>
     <p>
        As designers we've seen website owners get 'tired' of their perfectly good websites much too often, 
        deciding to do a full re-design that is both costly and time consuming. Get an objective opinion
        about whether your site really needs a full re-design, or whether a few tweaks will get the job done.
     </p>
        <br />
  	 <h3 class="title">Why not use a web design company?</h3>
     <p> 
        Asking a web design company if you need a new website is like asking a hairdresser if you need a 
        haircut - the answer is always yes! 
        <br /><br />
        InputFarm's experts are not looking to sell you a site re-design (in fact they'll never try to sell
        you further paid services). Instead they'll look for the 'low hanging fruit' - how to make your site
        better with the least amount of effort. Once you receive the review you can either make the changes
        yourself or get your designer to do it for you.
     </p>

  <div id="right_why">
  	 <h3>How much does it cost?</h3>
        $60
        <br />
        InputFarm removes all the extraneous work that a designer would ordinarily have to do - quotes,
        client meetings, client communications and reports.
        <br /><br />
        By removing all this extra work they can provide this service at a very reasonable rate.
     <br />
     <br />
  	 <h3>What do I get for my money ?</h3>
      <p>
        Your site gets reviewed by an expert for 30 minutes and they give you a report
        containing:
        <ul style='padding-left:20px'>
          <li>Annotated markup of your site</li>
          <li>What they think is good about your site</li>
          <li>What could be improved and how</li>
          <li>The first 3 things they would do if they were working on it</li>
        </ul>
        <br />
